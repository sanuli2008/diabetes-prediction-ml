# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning 

##  Project Overview

This project is an **end-to-end machine learning classification system** that predicts whether a person is likely to have **diabetes** based on medical diagnostic measurements.

The project is implemented by following the YouTube tutorial:
**"Project 2: Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning with Python | End To End Python ML Project"** by **Siddhardhan**.

The primary aim of this project is to gain hands-on experience with the **complete machine learning pipeline**, from data preprocessing to building a predictive system.

##  Objectives

* Load and understand the diabetes dataset
* Perform data preprocessing and feature selection
* Split the dataset into training and testing sets
* Train a machine learning classification model
* Evaluate model performance
* Build a predictive system for new input data

---

##  Dataset Information

* The dataset contains medical and demographic features of patients
* Each record represents a patient
* Target variable:

  * `0` → Non-Diabetic
  * `1` → Diabetic

### Common Features Include:

* Pregnancies
* Glucose Level
* Blood Pressure
* Skin Thickness
* Insulin Level
* Body Mass Index (BMI)
* Diabetes Pedigree Function
* Age
